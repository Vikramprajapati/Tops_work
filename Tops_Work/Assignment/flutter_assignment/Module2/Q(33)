How Dart Implements Multiple Inheritance: Mixins
In Dart, multiple inheritance is simulated using mixins. A mixin is a way to reuse code across multiple classes without forming a complex class hierarchy. Mixins allow you to add methods and properties to a class from other classes or mixins.

Key Concepts
Single Inheritance: A Dart class can extend only one superclass.
Mixins: Dart allows a class to use multiple mixins. Mixins can be thought of as classes that are intended to be mixed into other classes.
Defining and Using Mixins
Hereâ€™s how you can define and use mixins in Dart:

1. Define a Mixin

A mixin is defined using the mixin keyword. It can contain methods and properties but cannot have constructors.

2. Use Mixins in a Class

You can apply multiple mixins to a class using the with keyword. The class can then use the methods and properties provided by these mixins.
