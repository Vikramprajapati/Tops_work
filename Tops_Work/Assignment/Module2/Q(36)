When to Override:

. Inheritance: You use overriding when you want to change the behavior of a method in a subclass that is already defined in its superclass.
. Polymorphism: It allows for polymorphism, where a subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

When to Overload:

. Same Method Name, Different Parameters: You overload methods when you want to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or numbers in the same class.
. Clarity and Convenience: It can improve code clarity by allowing you to use the same method name for related actions, making the API more intuitive.
