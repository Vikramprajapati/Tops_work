No, a class cannot extend itself in Dart. In object-oriented programming, extending a class means creating a new class that inherits from an existing class, gaining its properties and methods. Extending a class by itself would create an infinite loop and is logically and syntactically invalid.

Why Can't a Class Extend Itself?
Logical Reasoning: Extending a class by itself would create a recursive hierarchy with no end, leading to an infinite loop. This is both conceptually incorrect and would result in an error during compilation.

Syntax and Compilation: Dart's syntax and compiler are designed to prevent such recursive and invalid constructs. Allowing a class to extend itself would violate the principles of class hierarchy and object-oriented design.
